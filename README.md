This is a Faculty Development database for Berea College used to keep record demographics of faculty members that 
attend different faculty development related events and activities. This project was apart of a service-learning
course called Database Systems (CSC 330). In this course, we were divided up into groups and given a "community
partner" from the town or college that needed a database made. The purpose of the course was to learn both hard skills
needed to develop a database system and website and soft skills needed to communicate clearly with our community partner
and design and document our work well for both our understanding and the community partner's understanding. I worked
on this project with three other colleagues who are listed below. Even though I contributed equally to this project as
the rest of my team, I did not have a copy of the files, so this code has been COPIED, with permission, from Quinten
Lambert's repository on his GitHub account (Oklane). 

Langauges used: PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS

Personal contributions: All functionality for Activities pages, help on other pages, and codevelopment of the database
    with Christopher Hunt. 

Teammates and GitHub Accounts:
